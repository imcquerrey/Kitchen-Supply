# Kitchen-Supply
A project a college student asked me to complete which was an order management system. You log into a customer account, add products to your cart, then procede to the checkout and view the cart toal. Items in your cart can be modified during the checkout. Information on products are read in as json and customer data is stored as a csv file. When a customer makes a purchase their balance is updated and a new entry is added to the order log file. When you log into an employee account you can go into inventory edit mode and change the avialable product quanity of a given item.
